# Chiyo!

So this was a project I was doing when I first started python. 

Today I decided to rewrite to there are more features!

To see all commands you can do ``;help`` to see all the commands!

You can invite Chiyo [right here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=705176662366486529&permissions=8&scope=bot)

# if you want to rewrite it for your own purposes here is a little tutorial.

This was made for [Python 3.6.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

1. install requirments ``pip3 install -r requirement.txt``

2. Run the main file! ``python3 Chiyo.py``

If there are any errors or you just have a question ask me on discord! ``Cover#8860``
